# Simon Says - Virtual Game
Welcome to Simon Says, the virtual adaptation of the classic game!


# Description
Simon Says is a digital version of the popular game that tests your memory, attention, and reflexes.
The game involves following a sequence of commands issued by Simon, the virtual leader.
Pay close attention to the commands, but remember, only follow those that start with 'Simon says.' 
Acting on commands without this prefix will lead to elimination. The game progressively challenges your
cognitive abilities by increasing the complexity of the sequences.
